# webpack-react-starter
Tired of doing project setups over and over again ? This is your package, you can start from here! 

# why 
Sometimes is good to use create-react-app, but it could be difficult to understand what's happening behind scenes. Here you will see every configuration file near to your hand to be changed as you want 

# how ?
Ok, maybe this is NOT THE BEST, but you will have to clone this repo in the following way -

```
> git clone git@github.com:alancampora/webpack-react-starter.git ./
```

and change the origin to your recently created repo

```
> git remote set-url origin <git@github.com:your-remote-url>

```

And that's it!
